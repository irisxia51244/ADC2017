General Purpose
------
Implementing a single-thread client-server application,a file server, 
connecting through a TCP. Client is able to send a single or multiple
message to the server. The proposed file server supports the following
operations: read, mkdir, rmdir, opendir, upload and download.

Usage
------
- To compile:
```
g++ -o server server.cpp
```
```
g++ -o client client.cpp
```
- To run the server:
```
./server
Server should run firstly.
```
- To run the client:
```
./client
```
- To make operations:
Follow the instruction, enter the corresponding number of the operation,
then, enter the desired file name.

Details
-------
This file server can support 6 operations:
1. read 
2. mkdir
3. rmdir
4. opendir
5. upload
6. download

Detail:
1. read: client should enter the function number "1" and then enter the file name to read the file. The content of this file will be printed on the screen. 
```
Please enter the function number:
